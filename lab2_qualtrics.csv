                                                       ---The Life Satisfaction and Sleep Survey--- You are invited to participate in a research study for researchers to collect more data on how life satisfaction and sleep quality and amount correlate with one another. This study poses no health risks. However, we may ask you confidential information about your age, gender, and characteristics involving your sleep and quality of life. This information will help us learn how college students are affected by their sleep habits and how this affects their overall happiness. Your data will be anonymously reported and will be kept confidential. This study is being conducted by Jessica Hicks, Elizabeth Duvall, Nicholas Burton, and Xan Rowland under the instruction of Dr. Susan Doughty and Dr. Robert Franklin and with help from Carly Gilstrap. You were selected as a possible participant because you are a college student in the freshman or sophomore class. If you are not in the sophomore or freshman class in a University or College setting, then your data will be discarded.  If you decide to participate, we will provide access to a survey that includes questions on your sleep habits and factors that affect your life satisfaction. This survey should take a maximum of 15 minutes. This survey includes questions that could be sensitive to some participants. If you prefer not to answer, you may leave the survey at any time. 
By obtaining data from participants, the researchers involved in this study look forward to gaining insight on how professors, parents, and the students themselves can increase the satisfaction of college students by examining how their sleep habits are affecting their lives and if they should be improved. Findings could potentially be included in introductory classes and various health classes. We cannot promise you that you will receive any or all of the benefits described. Any information obtained in connection with this study and that can be identified with you will remain anonymous. Participants are not required to give their names or any other characteristics that will allow others to identify them. Data will be collected by researchers and will not be able to be traced back to the individuals that took this survey. None of your identifiable information will be included while presenting findings.                         Your decision whether or not to participate will not jeopardize your future relations with Anderson University.  If you have any questions, Dr. Robert Franklin at rfranklin@andersonuniversity.edu, Dr. Susan Doughty at sdoughty@andersonuniversity.edu, Jessica Hicks at jhicks101@andersonuniversity.edu, Nicholas Burton at nburton102@andersonuniversity.edu, Xan Rowland at erowland@andersonuniversity.edu, or Elizabeth Duvall at eduvall100@andersonuniversity.edu will be happy to answer them. You will be provided a copy of this form to keep.
