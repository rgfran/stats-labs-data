## Materials for two semesters of Statistics in the Behavioral Sciences using R

These are the teaching materials I use to teach two semesters of undergraduate statistics to behavioral science majors. The first semester is focused partially on theory and partially on conducting stats using R and R Studio. The second semester is almost entirely practical and lab and computer based.

Stats I covers an introduction to R and RStudio, basic graphing and data summary, R Notebooks, correlation, basic linear regression, and t-tests. Stats II builds on this by adding more graphing and data formatting, multiple regression and moderation, and ANOVA (between with aov() and within and repeated-measures using the ez() package).

These materials are helpful to try to learn R if you have some stats background, as they are missing some of the technical theory. Please feel free to use them and let me know if you have any questions or other suggestions and additions.
